Window system using pure HTML + CSS + JS

# Bugs
1) ~~When dragging the window out of boundaries and ability to scroll appears, attempting to resize the window after scrolling is doing it incorrectly~2) If you try to move the window out of boundaries without resizing it first, the window and its letters will squish a bit. Probably caused by window having no height and width until you drag it first time~~
3) Really bad text parsing code
4)
5) ~~Everything breaks when you resize it to be very small~~
6) The rounding is applied to body{} which is a bad idea
7) Hard to read code
8) Questionable algorithms
9) Mobile users can't do anything
10) ~~Whenever you drag the window, the drag div doesnt actually stick to the mouse itself, it sticks to the opposite from the div side, which is very weird and unexplainable, i tried to change formulas but I can't get myself to actually think how to fix it~~

# Ideas
1) Ability to attach windows to grid and to other windows, add system of tabs (very hard)
~~2) Ability to customize new windows based on input (very hard)~~ it's a lot easier than i thought
3) Turn it to actual ~~resume~~ (hard) it's called portfolio*
4) Make somewhat decent design (hard)
~~5) Make window system as simple as calling a function or two (normal)~~ done?
6) Make it usable from mobiles (normal) can do but one of functions is not a good thing to use
7) Resize windows and font based on your current window size (normal)
~~8) Routing for different test projects (?)~~ /test.html
~~9) Do anything with cookies (?)~~ not ideas why i would use cookies for window manager
~~10) Use vue.js or something (?)~~ different project
~~11) Not sure if it's possible, but if I had money and could afford to buy a server, it'd be a nice idea to add annonymous chat that fetches everything it needs from the server that i'd buy (?; however security requirements would make it very hard)~~ another project 
?) get motivation to work on it (insanely difficult)

~~?) get $$$ for any of my effort (impossible)~~ anyone can make a better window manager
