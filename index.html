            <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
            <p>I am currently learning javascript and have some knoweldge in OOP programming, Unity C# programmng to be more specific. I tried learning react.js a bit and understand some core concepts and ideas, and have a tiny experience. This website specifically was made on pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, no libraries or frameworks used.</p>
            <p>For now there are windows that i made and basic window creation with argument text area that accepts ONLY size and text, in given particular order with lowercase. I plan to make a more advanced text parser and make an entire window system console, or something like that. Honestly, I don't like the window idea, but I've had no idea what to make, I came to conclusion to make something random and to keep working on it. The windows were my random decision. </p>
            <p>It is more of a practice thing rather than actually full big serious project, even though this practice, involves attempting to make a full big serious project</p>
         </div>
         <button onclick="AppendHolder(headerInfo, true, true, 1500)">Turn it to a window</button>

            <!--issues with this textarea is that i can't set its height by default? 
                and the input is saved when you update page and 
                it can be resized on its width which makes it feel weird, fix later?
                in face the text area might go out of borders and user wow n't be able to change it lol -->
